        <p class="lead mb-4"> My career goals are to protect and represent those without of a voice and the innocent this is why I am an activist for not just only human rights but for animals as well.Animal cruelty contains a range of behaviors done by humans that are harmful to animals. Animal cruelty can take many forms, from intential acts like factory farming of animals, the use of animals for laboratory testing and the neglect of pets by their owners. Animal rights activists have been at the forefront advocating and protesting for the rights of animals to live happy, stress-free and cruelty-free lives. Their efforts are commendable but it is time for every individual, including governments to adopt policies that ensure that all animals are able to achieve this type of life style. Personally, I believe in the need for changes in existing laws to ensure that the rights of animals to be able to live happy, cruelty-free lives and that they are respected. The federal government should enact laws that provides for the minimum conditions that animals in different settings. They should be kept and be given financial and custodial sentences to people or organizations found guilty for violating these laws.

        Volunteering at the Los Angeles Veteran Affairs Hospital has made an impact not just to myself, but also to my community. The VA Hospital supports by collecting donations and organizing events for veterans to receive the necessary essentials free of charge. My path to finding this volunteer opportunity came through my sister, who currently works at the VA. However, I have always wanted to volunteer for an organization that gave back to those who have sacrificed their lives in order to fight for the freedoms we have here at home. This experience challenged me in various ways, but also provided me with great insight. Given that I was the only youth volunteer at the organization, I was able to get more hands-on experience at the pharmacy. In pharmacy, I had to organize medications, throw out all of the expired medications and scan medication receipts to see if the veteran's prescriptions were expired. I knew I was making an impact because I was able to help many homeless veterans by giving them clothes, food, and essentials that they have no access to. Volunteering there made me realize the daily lives homeless veterans have to go through and I got to see the resources that veterans are able to access.<br><br>

              • During my experience in volunteering I learned time management and how to be organized. During the opening of the soccer season, I would have to help parents register their children to play soccer and later on would have to file those papers.<br>
              •  Would also be a part of the award ceremonies were we had to set up everything and make sure every child had a trophy to receive and to make sure all the teams from our region were present.<br>
